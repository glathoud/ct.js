# ct.js

Compile-time function execution in JavaScript (inspired from the D language)

Examples: [expl.js](expl.js)

...which rely on a minimal implementation: [ct.js](ct.js)

There is also a [live page](https://glat.info/ct.js/) where you can see the whole code at once, and play with the examples in the JS Console.
